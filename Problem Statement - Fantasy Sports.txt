Problem Statement â€“ Fantasy Sports Clustering Analysis
ðŸ“˜ Context:

Fantasy sports platforms allow users to create virtual teams composed of real-life professional athletes, earning points based on the players' actual game performance. Participants aim to build the most effective team within a limited budget to maximize their fantasy points and compete over a season or league. These platforms often involve real money, with rewards such as cash prizes or free matchday tickets.

The fantasy sports industry has grown significantly in recent years, reaching a valuation of $18.6 billion in 2019. Football (soccer) led the market with over 8 million users globally and continues to dominate. This growth is largely driven by increasing smartphone usage and the global reach of fantasy sports apps. By 2027, the market is projected to grow to $48.6 billion, fueled by digital engagement and global participation.
ðŸŽ¯ Objective:

OnSports, a global fantasy sports provider, hosts leagues for various sports and has seen rapid user growth over the past five years.
